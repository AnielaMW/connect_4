  # As a player
  # I want to drop a piece in a column
  # So that I can attempt to win the game
  # Acceptance Criteria:
  #
  # The player must specify a valid column. If they provide something invalid, inform them they must select a valid column and do not drop a game piece.
  # When the player specifies a valid column, place their respective game piece in the first available row in that column.
  # When the player specifies a valid column, it becomes the next players turn.

  # As a player
  # I want to know I cannot drop a piece in a full column
  # So that I can make an effective move
  # Acceptance Criteria:
  #
  # When a player selects a column that is full of game pieces (there is no available row), they are told that the column is full and they are prompted to select another column.

  # As a player
  # I want to know I've won the game
  # So that I can feel accomplished in my victory
  # Acceptance Criteria:
  #
  # Upon their turn, if a player drops a piece that makes a vertical or horizontal line of 4 of their pieces consecutively, they have won and the game is over.
  # Inform the player of their victory, and ask if they want to play again.
  # If they want to play again, keep the same players but clear the game board.

  # As a player
  # I want to know the game is over when the board is full
  # So we know the game has ended in a draw
  # Acceptance Criteria:
  #
  # When the board is full, meaning all rows and columns are occupied, the game is at a stalemate, resulting in a draw.
  # Inform the users that the game is a draw, and ask if they want to play again.
  # If they want to play again, keep the same players but clear the game board.
